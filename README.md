# Things to Fix in chronological order. Top to bottom
- mush doesn't install.
- mush doesn't launch. NOPE
- ~we will start croshunblocker when chrome starts by spoofing chrome like we did with tpmc.~ NO do this with an extension. Murkmod already solved it. We're idiots.
- Remember to put info for skids at the bottom of the inevitable faq
- ~Fix when powerwash "my chwomebook did a fucky a wucky"~ Dimmed down a little but didn't entirely get rid of them
- Chromebook also bootloops and is not recoverable (Research wtf a recovery key and how this connected to resetting chrome os)
