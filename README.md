# Things to Fix in chronological order. Top to bottom
- murkmod-devmode.sh doesn't work cause image-patcher.sh cause for some reason recovery image was like fuck this and dissapeared.
- mush doesn't install and doesn't launch. (Obvious)
- ~we will start croshunblocker when chrome starts by spoofing chrome like we did with tpmc.~ NO do this with an extension. Murkmod already solved it. We're idiots.
- Remember to put info for skids at the bottom of the inevitable faq
- ~Fix when powerwash "my chwomebook did a fucky a wucky"~ Add an option to the installation script to add the boot messages or not
- ~Chromebook also bootloops and is not recoverable~ WP has to be disabled for this and chromebook powerwashed while utk is installed. 
# Things to do going in chronological order. Top to Bottom. 
- ~Fork Murkmod to this repo because I'm a dumbass and didn't do it~
- ~Upload base grunt with murkmod for reference (Doesn't have everything but it's a rough starting point)~ (Uploaded partial rootfs we don't need the whole rootfs)
- ~Spoof TPM with fake tpm (Almost done need tpmc command to find out dev mode)~ 
- ~implement Murkmod within RMA shim~ (Murkmod already did this)
- ~Put Logo in boot via frecon over Chrome OS logo~ (Murkmod solved this for us)
- ~Design UTK logo~
- ~Add cryptosmite/Sh1mmer both to RMA shim and crosh~ (It's probably in crosmidi)
